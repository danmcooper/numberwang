/**
 * Metrics that gate a generated puzzle after the fact.
 *
 * `criminals` is excluded because criminal count carries no difficulty
 * signal (rho 0.301, and Medium/Tricky/Hard means sit within 0.23 of each
 * other): generation samples it from the union of every label's range
 * rather than the target label's own band, so gating on it here would
 * reject puzzles for a distinction that isn't real. It is still recorded in
 * `BANDED` as information.
 *
 * `meanRevealsPerStep` is excluded because it is redundant with
 * `chainLength`, not because it lacks signal: rho(chainLength,
 * meanRevealsPerStep) = -1.0000 exactly, and chainLength ×
 * meanRevealsPerStep = 19 for every one of the 54 archived puzzles — a
 * single distinct value, because both are just views of "cards the chain
 * must reveal" (20 minus the one initial reveal). Gating both would gate one
 * quantity twice and over-constrain generation for no added discrimination.
 * It stays in `BANDED` for the same reason: still worth recording, just not
 * worth enforcing on top of `chainLength`.
 *
 * `meanPathSize` is excluded not because it lacks signal but because the
 * generator cannot currently reach it. Measured like-for-like — recomputing
 * each archived card's stored reveal-prefix path through `minimalPaths` so
 * the archive is measured the same way a generated puzzle is (see
 * `scripts/calibrate.mts`) — it is the STRONGEST human-difficulty signal
 * available: rho +0.686, monotone across four of five labels (Easy 2.52,
 * Medium 2.78, Tricky 3.08, Hard 3.53; Brutal 3.07 on only 3 samples),
 * beating both `abstractShare` (+0.546) and `clueCards` (-0.565). But
 * `buildChain` + `minimalPaths` on a freshly generated chain lands
 * `meanPathSize` around 1.3–1.9 regardless of label — well below even Easy's
 * calibrated floor — because generated chains currently need less
 * supporting context per deduction than any archived puzzle.
 *
 * That gap is not an artifact of the minimiser stalling higher when seeded
 * from the archive's larger stored paths, which was the obvious confound.
 * Re-running the archive side with `minimalPaths(..., attempts=12)` instead of
 * the default 3 moves the means by -0.158 (2026-07-13 Easy 2.579→2.421),
 * -0.158 (2026-07-07 Medium 2.474→2.316) and 0.000 (2026-07-12 Brutal 3.368).
 * A ~6% shift does not close a gap of 1.0-1.5, and the label ordering is
 * unchanged, so the archive really does demand more support per deduction.
 *
 * Gating on it
 * today would make every label unreachable. It stays in `BANDED` so the gap
 * is recorded and visible; closing it (so generated puzzles genuinely need
 * as much support per card as their label implies) is tracked as follow-up
 * work, not papered over by gating on a target the generator cannot hit.
