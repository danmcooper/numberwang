 * against 70.0% uniform. That is most of the gap, and the remainder sits inside

 * puzzle is made of. Shuffling uniformly (what this used to do) reproduces the
 * pool's combinatorial shape: 58% of unit slots came out `between` against the
 * archive's 29%, and `number_of_traits_in_unit`, the archive's most common
 * clue at 14% of all clues, is 1.1% of the pool and so all but never appeared.
 *
 * Each candidate is weighted by how far its predicate and its features (unit
 * kinds, between-span lengths, directions — see `hintFeatures`) are over- or
 * under-represented in the pool relative to the archive, then drawn without
 * replacement by the Efraimidis–Spirakis trick (sort by -ln(u)/w), which is one
 * O(n log n) sort instead of the O(n^2) of renormalising after every draw.
 * Features are applied first and the predicate correction is measured against
 * the already-feature-weighted mass, so the two corrections compose instead of
 * fighting: the expected predicate mix is the archive's, and within a predicate
 * the features lean the archive's way too.
 *
 * Nothing is dropped. A candidate the archive never uses would get weight 0 and
 * sort to the back, but every predicate and feature `candidateHints` emits does
 * appear in the archive, so in practice this only reorders.
 */
/**
 * Per-hint weights whose feature marginals match `target`.
 *
 * Scaling each feature once by target/pool — what this used to do — does not
 * land on the target. A hint's weight is the product of its features' factors,
 * so a clue naming two colour groups picks the colour factor up twice,
 * and that factor is large: colour groups are 0.4% of the pool's unit slots
 * against the archive's 7%. The head came out at three times the archive's
 * colour rate, which is a worse error than the under-correction it was
 * fixing — the player notices "there are more criminal judges than criminal
 * doctors" twice a puzzle instead of once.
 *
 * So iterate: measure the weighted marginals, correct each feature by how far it
 * still is from target, repeat. This is iterative proportional fitting, and a
 * couple of dozen passes over precomputed feature lists costs nothing next to
 * the solving that follows.
 *
 * Two details keep the iteration on its feet. It is damped, because a feature
 * that is scarce in the pool and common in the archive asks for a big correction
 * and the hints carrying it carry other features too, so the full correction
 * overshoots those and the next pass overshoots back: undamped, the marginals
 * oscillate instead of settling, and the error is worse at pass 7 than at pass
 * 1. And the weights are rescaled each pass, because their absolute size is
 * meaningless — only ratios reach the draw — and left alone the product of
 * corrections runs to Infinity, at which point every weight is Infinity, every
 * sort key is 0, and the ordering is whatever order the pool was built in.
