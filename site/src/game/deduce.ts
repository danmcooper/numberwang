 * Whether the player has enough on the table to justify calling this card.
 *
 * `paths` is the fast answer: the generator (and the source site) record
 * sufficient sets of cards per card, so a matching one settles it without any
 * solving. But those recorded paths are a *sample*, not an enumeration —
 * `minimalPaths` greedily drops cards over a handful of orderings, so it finds
 * a few minimal sufficient sets and misses the rest. Treating that sample as
 * the whole truth counted correct deductions as mistakes: across the 54
 * generated puzzles, 32 of them rejected a card that the flipped clues plainly
 * forced, in one case a card that a single flipped clue announced outright.
 *
 * So a miss falls through to the question the paths were only ever a proxy
 * for: given exactly these flipped cards and their clues, is this card's trait
 * the same in every assignment that survives? That is the real rule of the
 * game, and it needs no puzzle regenerated to be right.
