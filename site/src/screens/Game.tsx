/** Columns the stylesheet's own breakpoints are written for: the source site's
 * board, and every Dan puzzle that inherits it. */
const NARROW_COLS = 4;

/**
 * A board wider than the source site's four columns is wider than a phone. The
 * cards are a fixed size, so the only thing that fits is the whole board, and
 * the stylesheet already scales it down for the same reason at its two narrow
 * breakpoints. This generalises that to any column count — but only above four,
 * so those breakpoints stay in sole charge of the boards they were measured on.
 *
 * `transform: scale` rather than `zoom`, because WebKit will not draw text
 * below a 9px floor and `zoom` cannot get under it. Measured in Safari at the
 * 10x10's own ratio of 0.4219: a card's box scales exactly, 87px to 36.7px,
 * while its 11px colour is inflated to a computed 21.3px so that it still
 * lands on 9px once zoomed — near twice the 4.64px the board asked for. The
 * words then overflow cards a third their size. `text-size-adjust` does not
 * reach this; it governs autosizing, which is a different mechanism, and
 * neither `100%` nor `none` moves the number. A transform never touches
 * font-size at all, so there is no size for WebKit to clamp: the same probe
 * puts it at 4.64px, which is the ask.
 *
 * What `zoom` was doing for us was scaling the layout, so the box the page
 * reserves is the board that gets drawn. A transform paints smaller without
 * shrinking its box, and an over-wide inline-block does not centre — it starts
 * at the container's edge and spills off one side, which is the board sitting
 * right of centre with its right-hand column off screen. So `.board-fit` is
 * given the painted size and `.board-wrap` keeps its natural one, which also
 * leaves everything positioned against the real board: the pause dim covers it,
 * and the mark pickers still hang off the right card.
 *
 * Negative margins were the tempting way to do that without another element,
 * and they only half work. `margin-right` collapses the width, but WebKit does
 * not let a negative `margin-bottom` shrink the line box an inline-block sits
 * in — measured, the page went on reserving all 1359px of a 10x10 and left
 * 800px of nothing under a board painted 573px tall. An explicit height on a
 * box that is not the transformed one is the thing that actually holds.
 *
 * The height has to be measured rather than derived, because it depends on how
 * many cards are showing clue text at this moment, hence the observer. Until
 * the first measurement lands there is no height to set, and the board paints
 * over the space below it for one frame rather than being clipped out of view.
 *
 * `.board-wrap` is switched to a block for the same reason it is scaled at all.
 * Sizing the outer box fixes what the page lays out but not what it lets you
 * scroll to: WebKit takes an inline-level box's contribution to scrollable
 * overflow from its unscaled size, so a fitted 10x10 still offered 1359px of
 * height and 915px of width to scroll through, almost all of it empty. A block
 * at the same explicit width contributes its transformed size and does not.
 * Clipping on the outer box would also have worked, and would have cut off the
 * mark pickers, which hang deliberately over the right-hand edge.
 *
 * The inline `zoom: 1` is not redundant. The stylesheet's own narrow
 * breakpoints zoom `.board-wrap`, and they are sized for the source site's
 * four columns rather than for a board that has already been fitted here —
 * left alone they would compound with the transform. They keep their boards;
 * this overrides them on ours.
 *
 * The ratio is measured here rather than left to `calc((100vw - 2rem) / 639px)`
 * in the stylesheet. Dividing a length by a length is CSS Values 4 and not
 * something every browser we might be opened in will do; an unsupported value
 * drops the whole declaration, which fails silently as no scaling at all. A
 * number is a number everywhere.
